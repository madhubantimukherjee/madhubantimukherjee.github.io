# About Me

I am a computational materials scientist with research focused on materials applications using density functional theory, molecular dynamics, and machine learning.

Currently, I work as a scientist in the Laboratory of Computational Chemistry and Biochemistry at EPFL, Switzerland, under the guidance of Prof. Ursula Röthlisberger. Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Georgia Tech, Atlanta, USA, mentored by Prof. Rampi Ramprasad.

I earned my PhD from the Materials Research Centre at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.

Originally from the small town of Medinipur in Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, India, I have a passion beyond science for reading, writing, and music. My interests also include exploring diverse cuisines, playing chess, and enjoying casual conversations—what Bengalis affectionately call "adda."
